Summary: This page summarizes the features of EP postprocessing tool

##Why you need this tool?
###Save time for post-processing procedure by automation. Dig into data more using the help of application.
Energy simulation generate lots of data which is hard to process all manually. Thus, it takes time to extract data which we are after. Hence, we did not have sufficient time and resource to feedback to actual design or influence to stakeholder. This application can help you to automate tedious post processing work. Even more, sophisticated visualization can give user more insight than conventional way.

##Postprocessing is just uploading
In order to use this application, what you have to do is just upload result html file. Then this application extract information and create graph for you. Instruction is summarized in [this page]({filename}/first-post.md)

##What you can do using this application?
###1.Visualize uploaded data
Once you have uploaded data, following pages can help you to understand simulation result.  
####Project list page  
 This page summarizes all the project uploaded to this applicaiton with some representative data such as program, locaiton, area, EUI, Unmet hour and so on.

####Project detail page  
 This page shows detail information such as energy consumption breakdown data and window wall ratio for each direction

####Basic information for each room  
 This page shows input information for each zone which affect to energy consumption. By looking at this page, user can check whether input information is right or not at a glance.

####Heat balance for each room  
 This page shows heat gain for each room. In south east asia region, cooling is one of the major energy consumption. Cooling load correlate to heat gain basically. So investigating heat gain in detail can help user to find out some opportunity to reduce energy consumption.

####Case comparison page  
 This page can show the case comparision for energy consumption. For energy simulation, knowing energy reduction compared to base case is the most important information. Once user upload result data for multiple version, they can check the energy reduction rapidly.  

###2.Query the energy simulation case
 Simulation data uploaded to database can be refferred to other project easily through the search page. User can search any project according to project name/program/location etc.
